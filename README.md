# About Kartaverse

Kartaverse is a free open-source post-production pipeline that is  optimized for the immersive media sector. If you can imagine it, Kartaverse can help you create it!

"Karta" is the Swedish word for map. With KartaVR you can stitch, composite, retouch, and remap any kind of panoramic video: from any projection to any projection. This provides the essential tools for 360VR, panoramic video stitching, depthmap, lightfield, and fulldome image editing workflows. 

Kartaverse makes it a breeze to accessibly and affordably create content for use with virtual reality HMDs (head mounted displays) and fulldome theatres by providing ready to go scripts, templates, plugins, and command-line tools that allow you to work efficiently with XR media. The toolset works inside of Blackmagic Design's powerful node based [Fusion Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion) and [DaVinci Resolve Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) software.

# Installation

Kartaverse is an open-source (GNU LGPL/GPL v3) toolset. It is distributed through the WSL [Reactor package manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067) for Resolve/Fusion. Install the Reactor package manager, and select the "Kartaverse" category on the left side of the Reactor GUI to access the tools.
