# <a name="overview"></a>Overview

> [Kartaverse](https://github.com/kartaverse) is an academic research project exploring computational imaging techniques. Kartaverse provides a post-production pipeline that is optimized for the immersive media sector. If you can imagine it, Kartaverse can help you create it in XR!

> "Karta" is the Swedish word for map. With Kartaverse you can stitch, composite, retouch, and remap any kind of panoramic video: from any projection to any projection. This provides the essential tools for 360VR, panoramic video stitching, depthmap, lightfield, and fulldome image editing workflows.

> Kartaverse makes it a breeze to accessibly and affordably create content for use with virtual reality HMDs (head mounted displays) and fulldome theatres by providing ready to go scripts, templates, plugins, and command-line tools that allow you to work efficiently with XR media. The toolset works inside of Blackmagic Design's powerful node based [Fusion Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion) and [DaVinci Resolve Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) software.
