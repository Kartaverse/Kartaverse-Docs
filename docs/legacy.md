# KartaVR Legacy Content

> The following KartaVR content was designed back in 2014-2017 for the Fusion (Free) v7.7, v8.2.1, and 9.0.2 era of fulldome and 360VR post-production. If you are wondering what you should use on a new project started today, skip the legacy macros, and just go with the Kartaverse fuse nodes!

> Some of this material might have relevancy for learning more about node based compositing workflows. However in Resolve/Fusion v19+ many of the techniques have been replaced by newer and faster to render Kartaverse DCTL Fuses.
