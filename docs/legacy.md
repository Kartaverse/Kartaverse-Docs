# <a name="legacy"></a>KartaVR Legacy Content

The following KartaVR content was designed back in 2016-2017 for the Fusion (Free) v8.2.1 and 9.0.2 era of 360VR. It still has some relevancy for learning more about node based compositing workflows but many of the techniques have been replaced by newer and faster to render Kartaverse DCTL Fuses.
