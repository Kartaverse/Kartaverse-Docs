## Kartaverse Example Project Files

Reactor stores the example Kartaverse project files in the PathMap based folder located at:  
```Reactor:/Deploy/Comps/Kartaverse/```

In DaVinci Resolve you can access the base Reactor folder using the "Workspaces > Scripts > Comp > Reactor > Tools > Show Comps Folder" menu item. In Fusion Studio this location can be accessed using the "Reactor > Tools > Show Comps Folder" menu item.

When the Reactor folder is opened in an Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS), or Nautilus (Linux) folder browsing window, you can then navigate into the "Kartaverse" sub-folder:
